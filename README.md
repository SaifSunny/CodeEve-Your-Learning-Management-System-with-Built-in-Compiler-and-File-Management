# CodeEve-Your-Learning-Management-System-with-Built-in-Compiler-and-File-Management

EveCode is a comprehensive learning management system that includes an in-built compiler for popular programming languages such as C, C++, PHP, JavaScript, and Python. It provides a platform for users to write, run, and debug their code with ease. The system is designed to cater to both individuals looking to improve their coding skills as well as academic organizations that want to provide their students with a seamless learning experience.

## Key Features

- In-built compiler system: With EveCode, you can write, debug and run your code directly from the platform without the need to switch to a separate environment.
- File management: Create, edit, delete, and download repos with ease. The system automatically overrides the previous code file each time you run the code.
- Free compiler: Even without logging into the system, you can use the free compiler to run your code. Your files will not be saved on the server in this case.
- Online courses: Sign up for courses designed and made by professional teachers and solve the designed lessons. Attempt the lessons directly on the compiler and view the prompt, write code and see the output in real-time.
- University classes: Join university classes if your academic organization purchases a subscription and uploads their course onto the system.

## Software used

EveCode has been developed using a combination of the latest web technologies, including:

- Bootstrap for the front-end design
- PHP for the backend
- MySQL for the database
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end functionality
- Ajax for asynchronous data transfer between the client and server
- ACE (https://ace.c9.io/) for compiler code debugging
